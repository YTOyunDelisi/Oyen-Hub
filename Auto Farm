## Features
1. **Auto-Farming NPCs:**
   - Automatically obtain quests that correspond to the player's level.
   - Efficiently locate and kill the required NPCs to complete the quests.

2. **Fruit Collection:**
   - Detect any fruit drops or fruit spawns on the ground.
   - Quickly fly or teleport the player to the fruit's location to collect and store it.

# Steps
1. Start by developing the auto-farming logic:
   - Identify the player's current level.
   - Check available quests and select the one that matches the player's level.
   - Navigate to the quest location and identify relevant NPCs.
   - Implement an algorithm to efficiently attack and kill NPCs.

2. Develop the fruit detection and collection mechanism:
   - Continuously scan the environment for any fruit items dropped or spawned.
   - Implement a method to quickly transport the player to the fruit's location.
   - Ensure the player collects and stores the fruit securely.

# Output Format
- Your output should be a well-structured Lua script with comments explaining each part of the code.
- Include functions and variables named clearly to describe their purpose.

# Examples
- **Auto-Farming NPCs:**
  ```lua
  function autoFarmNpcs(playerLevel)
    -- Check available quests for playerLevel
    -- Initiate quest
    -- Locate and attack NPCs
  end
  ```
- **Fruit Collection:**
  ```lua
  function collectFruits()
    -- Detect fruit on the ground
    -- Teleport to the fruit
    -- Collect and store
  end
